title: Lightning Talks
---

What is a lightning talk? It's a short presentation that:

* Lasts five minutes
* Delivers a message

Throughout the course we'll have lightning talks each Friday centered around a theme. We'll have six talks per week, so you'll present every fourth week. (_Given that our projects are a mix of two and three weeks long, this ensures that you won't always have to prepare a presentation during the same phase of our project work._)

### Constructing a Lightning Talk

Let's imagine that I'm putting together a lightning talk about the Pomodoro Technique.

#### Purpose

A purpose is not the same as a topic. My topic is "Pomodoro techique," but my purpose would be something like this:

| Convince developers that working in short bursts with frequent breaks is more productive than marathon work sessions

The purpose leads you to the conclusion of your talk. What is the *one thing* that your audience must walk away with?

#### Starting Point

* Who's in the audience? 
* What do they already know about this topic? 
* Are they already convinced of the purpose? If so, don't give the talk!

In my example, I'm speaking to 24 developers who have probably just started using pomodoros (by force) in the past week. The understand the mechanics, but not much about the message. Some of them think it's cool because you get lots of coffee breaks, but others think it's a waste of time. All of them probably think I'm unnecessarily a hardass about the start and end of pomodoros.

#### Supports

What arguments will I make to move the audience from the Starting Point to the Purpose/Conclusion?

* Health problems with sitting, reduced by frequent walking
* "Exclusionary time" where you focus on one thing
* Multi-tasking is a myth
* Tracking time via pomodoros
* Break time is (background) work time
* Dangers of sloppy clock management

#### Communication Style

Lightning talks are so short that you have many options for a presentation style:

* Naked: no support, just you and a mic. Strictly for stone cold presentation dominators.
* Text-Based: The easiest to construct. Distil your key concepts down to small fragements or phrases and use Keynote to present them one after another. Generally use *six or fewer* words per slide.
* Image-Based: Use only images with no text. This is really a riff on the naked talk because you have to remember what you're supposed to be saying without the text on screen to drive you.
* Text/Image Hybrid: The most common, some text, some images, usually a meme or two. It was cool in 2010, now it's a little...standard.
* Performance: The only thing more avant-garde than a naked talk is a performance talk: slam poetry, series of haikus, interpretive dance, original song, live drawing, or a group activity. You won't be forgotten, but with a short time it's difficult to deliver on your purpose.
* Story time: Regardless of your overall presentation style, telling a story is a great way to connect with people while illustrating your point

#### Practice
* Run through your lightning talk at least once.  You'll have much more confidence and your audience will appreciate the preparation.
* Make sure you can cover everything you want to within the five minute time limit.
* If you can, run through the presentation in front of another person.  They'll pick up things you would never notice on your own.

#### What Not to Do

Here are some of the common things that new presenters do which slaughter their credibility/purpose:

* Don't start off by discrediting your work with a comment like "Not sure how this is going to go, I've been up since 3am putting it together"
* Don't spend all your time looking at the ceiling, floor, or projector. Look at your audience, glance at your materials as necessary.
* Don't forget that Keynote offers a "presenter view" where you see what's coming next before the audience
* Don't use a bunch of fancy transitions and effects unless they're ironic. Most everything "3D" is off limits.
* Don't put full sentences on a slide, ever.
* Don't put long quotes then proceed to read them to the audience. Just use the author's photo and read it from your notes.
* Don't forget your purpose. If there's no takeaway, then there's no point.
