* Warm-Up
* Class: Refactoring Techniques

## Warm-Up

Pull down the [warmup-exercises](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises) repository at 8:50 for today's exercise.

## Workshop: Refactoring Techniques

Refactoring doesn't just mean magically moving code around. There are actual techniques and processes you can apply to improve the structure of code.

### References

* [Refactoring Methods](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/69001/Refactoring/Refactoring%20-%20Chapter%206.pdf)
* [Moving Features Between Objects](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/69001/Refactoring/Refactoring%20-%20Chapter%207.pdf)

### Chapter 6 Highlights

* Extract Method
* Inline Method
* Replace Temp with Query
* Replace Loop with Collection Closure Method
* Introduce Named Parameter

### Protocol

* Get together with your partner from *MicroBlogger*.
* Read the "Composing Methods" chapter up to at least page 147.
* Pick one of your two *SalesEngine* projects to refactor.
* The partner who does *not* own the project should go to the project page and create a fork.
* Clone down the fork and run the tests to make sure everything is running ok.
* Pick a few techniques from the reading, then hunt through the code for opportunities to apply them together.
* Before you refactor, change the implementation (maybe by commenting the method out or changing key logic) to make sure that some test(s) fail.
* Un-screw the code, apply your refactoring pattern, and make sure the test(s) pass.
* Commit, push to the fork, and submit a pull request to the original author.

When you're feeling good about those techniques, try applying the same process with techniques from "Chapter 7 - Moving Features Between Objects".

Please come back to the classroom at 11:45.
