### Testing Javascript with Jasmine with Elaine in The War Room

Just as we test our ruby code, we need to test our javscript. Jasmine is a javascript testing framework that uses language similar to rspec.

####Goal:
By the end of this session, we'll be able to write javascript specs and also know how to integrate jasmine with a rails application.

####Activities

1. Follow the tutorial from [How Do I Jasmine](http://evanhahn.com/how-do-i-jasmine/) to get a feel for jasmine
2. Translate one of the warmups to be jasmine specs and make them pass
3. Add some kind of form validation to blogger!
