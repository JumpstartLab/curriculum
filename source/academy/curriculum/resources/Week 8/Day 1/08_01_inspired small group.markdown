## ["Inspired"] by Marty Cagan: Small Group Discussions

Fork the `reading` repository and collate your group's notes into the appropriate file in [https://github.com/JumpstartLab/reading/tree/master/inspired/composite_notes](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/reading/tree/master/inspired/composite_notes).

Each member of the group is responsible for one discussion question and recording notes on the group's responses. It should **NOT** be one person taking notes the entire time. The person who poses the question takes the notes. When you're not taking notes, close your laptop.

Consider using an 8-minute timer for each question's discussion.

Submit 1 pull request for your group when you finish the notes. It should not contain changes to any files or folders other than your group's markdown file.
