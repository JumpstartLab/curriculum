## "Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us" by Daniel H. Pink" Small Group Discussion

Fork the `reading` repository and collate your group's notes into the appropriate file in [https://github.com/JumpstartLab/reading/tree/master/drive/composite_notes](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/reading/tree/master/drive/composite_notes)

Each member of the group is responsible for one discussion question and recording notes on the group's responses. It should **NOT** be one person taking notes the entire time. The person who poses the question takes the notes. When you're not taking notes, close your laptop.

Consider using an 8-minute timer for each question's discussion.

Submit 1 pull request for your group when you finish the notes. It should not contain changes to any files or folders other than your group's markdown file.

Be back in the main room, pull request submitted, and seated with your group at 4:00.
