# Outputting Text

The first and most widely used method of debugging Ruby application is simply outputting text data. Let's look at a few approaches at increasing levels of expertise.

## Reading a Request/Response

Greatly undervalued by newer Rails developers, the first stop when observing unexpected behavior should be the server log and the request/response information. Let's pick apart an example.

### Sample Request/Response

Here's an actual request from a sample application:

```text
1 Started POST "/products" for 127.0.0.1 at 2011-07-19 12:42:48 -0700
2   Processing by ProductsController#create as HTML
3   Parameters: {"utf8"=>"âœ“", "authenticity_token"=>"E3aGszU+Xmdq3bs9woAtMzH93zy34Z9lQqiNHwLACRY=", "product"=>{"title"=>"Apples", "price"=>"5.99", "stock"=>"12", "description"=>"A bag of apples.", "image_url"=>"apples.jpg"}, "commit"=>"Create Product"}
4   User Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" IS NULL LIMIT 1
5   Order Load (1.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."id" = 48 LIMIT 1
6   AREL (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "products" ("title", "price", "description", "image_url", "created_at", "updated_at", "stock") VALUES ('Apples', 5.99, 'A bag of apples.', 'apples.jpg', '2011-07-19 19:42:48.457003', '2011-07-19 19:42:48.457003', 12)
7 Redirected to http://localhost:3000/products/3
8 Completed 302 Found in 117ms
```

Here are some of the facts we can learn from reading the request:

* Line1: It executed a `POST` request for `/products` which should trigger the `create` action of `ProductsController`. Is this the controller and action intended? Especially scrutinize the request verb, this is a common place for mixups.
* Line2: It did attempt to execute `ProductsController#create`
* Line3: The params hash. Look for elements that are blank/nil. Is the structure reasonable? Unfortunately, because of the UTF-8 checkmark, this hash can't be copy/pasted into the console for testing. If you have trouble navigating this hash:
  * Copy it from the log output
  * Paste it into a text editor
  * Remove the `utf8` key/value pair
  * Copy the result
  * Paste it into console and experiment
  * Inspect whether attributes are correctly nested, correctly named, etc
* Lines 4-6: See the SQL interactions. Particularly pay attention to `INSERT` statements. Is the information from the Line 3 params in the `INSERT` or are there a bunch of `nil` fields? The most common issue you'll spot here is this:
  ```text
    WARNING: Can't mass-assign protected attributes: [your attributes here]
  ```
  In that case, look in the model for the `attr_accessible` method call and see if additional fields should be made accessible. Note that the suffix matters, so making `product` accessible will not automatically accept `product_id`, list both to allow mass-assignment via ID number or actual object.
* Last Lines: Redirect or render and HTML status code. Usually not helpful unless the app is redirecting you somewhere unexpected.

Just to say it one more time, the issue about *Can't mass-assign protected attributes* is the number one most common issue new Rails developers spend hours debugging. Just look for that message in the log and you'll have it fixed in seconds.
 
## Temporary Instructions

Let's next look at adding temporary instructions to our application. 

### Using Warn

Looking at the server log gave lots of great info, but it doesn't help with inspecting the values of variables or instructions. For that job, use the `warn` method of Ruby's `Kernel` object. Here's how I might insert it into the `create` action used above:

```ruby
def create
  @product = Product.new(params[:product])
  warn "Product before save:"
  warn @product.inspect
  if @product.save
    redirect_to @product, :notice => "Successfully created product."
  else
    render :action => 'new'
  end
end
```

Then in the output log see the results:

```text
Product before save:
#<Product id: nil, title: "Apples", price: nil, description: nil, image_url: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, stock: 0>


Started POST "/products" for 127.0.0.1 at 2011-07-19 13:18:26 -0700
  Processing by ProductsController#create as HTML
```

Notice that the warn comes out before where the log claims it is "starting" the response. The `warn` is output immediately, while the normal logging operations are buffered and output all together. When I use warn I'll typically put in some label to the output, like the `Product before save` here. The messages for `warn` are just strings, so you can use `\n` newlines or other text formatting to make them easier to read.

### Platform Notifications

[TODO: Section on Growl? Does it work via the Growl gem?]

### Raising Exceptions

One of my most frequently used techniques is to intentionally raise an exception. If I wanted to check out the `@product` object during the `create` action and maybe look at the parameters of the request, I'd typically do this:

```ruby
def create
  @product = Product.new(params[:product])
  raise @product.inspect
  if @product.save
  #...
```

The `raise` will immediately halt execution and display Rails' normal error page. The `raise` method accepts one parameter, a string, which will be output as the error message.

With this usage you'd see something like this:

```
RuntimeError in ProductsController#create
#<Product id: nil, title: "Apples", price: nil, description: nil, image_url: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, stock: 0>
```

The first line specifying that it was a general `RuntimeError` exception and the second line is the message, the result of our `inspect`. Generally `inspect` is a better choice than `to_s` as it'll show more about the object's internal state.

Also, further down the page you'll see the request's parameters formatted in a YAML debug block.

This is my favorite debugging technique when writing Rails applications because you don't have to dig through anything -- execution halts right at your message.  You can even use `raise` in conjunction with Ruby's here-docs and string interpolation:

```
raise <<-EOS

params: #{params.inspect}


@product: #{@product.inspect}

>>
```

### Debug Helper

If you can get to the point of execution where a view template is being rendered, then you can take advantage of the `debug` helper method. It accepts one object as an argument and outputs a nicely formatted YAML representation of the object wrapped in `<pre>` tags. The build-in Rails stylesheet already has styles for the `<pre>` tags for this reason.
  
For instance, in the form used with the `create` action, I could insert `debug` like this:

```erb
<%= debug @product %>
```

Then when the view is rendered the YAML output will be visible. 

But there's a serious problem with adding debug code -- it tends to get left behind and sent into production! One solution I've used is to define this helper in `ApplicationHelper`:

```ruby
  def d(object)
    debug object if Rails.env == "development"
  end
```

Then in the view templates just use it instead of the built in `debug`:

```erb
<%= d @product %>
```

Now any debug code would be hidden in production. Want to take it a step further? How about this:

```ruby
def d(object)
  if Rails.env == "development"
    debug object 
  else
    raise "Debug code running in test & production!"
  end
end
```

Now, assuming that you have coverage of your views in automated tests, debug code will both not be displayed and never be permitted to run in production!

## A Custom Logger

Let's say you want to debug or log a more complex process. Maybe it involves several "checkpoints" across multiple methods. Or you want to build an audit trail for actions in your application. You need a custom logger.

It's very easy to create and use thanks to Rails `ActiveSupport::BufferedLogger`. Imagine we want to build an audit log for our application. Start with an initializer `config/initializers/audit_logger.rb`

```ruby
module Kernel
  @@audit_log = ActiveSupport::BufferedLogger.new("log/audit.log")
  def audit(message)
    return unless %w(development test).include?(Rails.env) # production guard!
    preamble = "\n[#{caller.first}] at #{Time.now}\nMessage: " 
    @@audit_log.add 0, preamble + message.inspect
  end
end
```

Then anywhere in your application call the `audit` method:

```ruby
def create
  @product = Product.new(params[:product])
  audit @product.inspect
  if @product.save
    #...
```

Pop open `log/audit.log` and you'll find messages like this:

```text
[/path/to/your/app/controllers/products_controller.rb:18:in `create'] at 2011-07-19 14:12:16 -0700
Message: "#<Product id: nil, title: \"Apples\", price: nil, description: nil, image_url: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, stock: 0>"
```

Tweak the formatting to your liking, then add auditing wherever needed in your application!

### Heroku Logs

That's great for development, but what about accessing our logs in production?

The first step is to enable Heroku's "Expanded" logging add-on. From within your project directory, assuming it is already running on Heroku:

```bash
heroku addons:add logging:expanded
```

#### Fetching Logs

Getting logs from Heroku is simple:

```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

Which will give you output like this:

```text
$ heroku logs
2010-09-16T15:13:46-07:00 app[web.1]: Processing PostController#list (for 208.39.138.12 at 2010-09-16 15:13:46) [GET]
2010-09-16T15:13:46-07:00 app[web.1]: Rendering template within layouts/application
2010-09-16T15:13:46-07:00 app[web.1]: Rendering post/list
2010-09-16T15:13:46-07:00 app[web.1]: Rendered includes/_header (0.1ms)
2010-09-16T15:13:46-07:00 app[web.1]: Completed in 74ms (View: 31, DB: 40) | 200 OK [http://myapp.heroku.com/]
2010-09-16T15:13:46-07:00 heroku[router]: GET myapp.heroku.com/posts queue=0 wait=0ms service=1ms bytes=975
2010-09-16T15:13:47-07:00 app[worker.1]: 2 jobs processed at 16.6761 j/s, 0 failed ...
```

The marker in `[]` corresponds to the dyno generating the message. The log aggregates information from all your dynos and workers, so it's great for tracking down complex interactions between components.
